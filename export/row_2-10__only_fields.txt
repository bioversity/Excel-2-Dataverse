A contribution of Bioversity International to the Dryland Systems CGIAR Research Programme (CRP) [http://drylandsystems.cgiar.org/] has been to examine systematically the diversity of these species in CRP target sites in Mali, Ghana, Malawi and India. Bioversity and partners have carried out a set of Agricultural Biodiversity Assessments in these countries. In the case of Mali, the selected sites include two villages in the Sikasso region: Kani and Farakoro. These villages have been already part of an ICRISAT baseline survey. An additional village, NâGoutjina, was selected by Bioversity to complement the work. Here we present the protocols used for collecting the data from Mali.
The objective of the ABD Assessment is to identify and quantify all the useful plant, animal, and aquatic species utilized by rural households and communities in the Dryland Systems CRP sites, as well as information on markets attended and general socioeconomic household characteristics. This information will be used to characterize three dimensions of ABD: (1) diversity in the production system, including on farm and common lands; (2) dietary diversity; and (3) market diversity; in terms of the elements and relationships involved and the exogenous factors that influence their status and dynamics. These data will be the basis for analyzing the roles of ABD in the lives and livelihoods of these rural populations in order to identify entry points for designing and implementing interventions that contribute to improve their well-being.

In the context of the CGIAR Research Program on Dryland Production Systems and with its support, Bioversity International and partners carried out a series of Assessments in selected sites of Ghana, India, Malawi, Mali and Niger. As a result several datasets have been produced. This document provides a background and an overview of the data that have been collected. It offers the conceptual framework that guided its design, the context in which the Assessment was carried out, and a short description of the protocols and methods used, as well as a link to the documents and datasets.

Two FGDs per village in three villages. FGDs were held separately for men and women in order to collect gender disaggregated data
In each of the three villages, two focus group discussions were held separately. One with men and the other with women. Each group will deal with the three aspects for discussion:
Useful biological diversity in the production system; Market diversity; and Dietary diversity.  There were between 10-16 participants in each group. Each group tried to include a cross-section of individuals involved in agricultural production or at least collecting useful plants from common lands and the wild, representing different levels of access to land (land owners, local land renters and migrant land renters), different ethnic groups present in the village and different age groups (special emphasis should be placed to include younger farmers). For each group there were two facilitators, one to guide the exercise and the other to document the process (take notes, photographs, etc.). The  data were elicited using the four-square methodology explained in the Protocol document.
The three villages survey were in the Sikasso District of Mali: Fakoro (Lat 12Â°13074, Lon 005Â°20156); Kani (Lat 12Â°15011, Lon 005Â°10827); N'goutjina (Lat 12Â°17961, Lon 005Â°28372)

Two FGDs per village in three villages. FGDs were held separately for men and women in order to collect gender disaggregated data.
Geographic area includes: Three villages in the  Lawra District of Ghana: Bonpari (Lat 10.67, Lon W002.81); Gbelinkaa (Lat N10.58, Lon W002.83); Yagtuur (Lat N10.55, Lon W 002.86)
In each of the three villages, two focus group discussions were held separately. One with men and the other with women. Each group will deal with the three aspects for discussion:
Useful biological diversity in the production system; Market diversity; and Dietary diversity.  There were between 10-16 participants in each group. Each group tried to include a cross-section of individuals involved in agricultural production or at least collecting useful plants from common lands and the wild, representing different levels of access to land (land owners, local land renters and migrant land renters), different ethnic groups present in the village and different age groups (special emphasis should be placed to include younger farmers). For each group there were two facilitators, one to guide the exercise and the other to document the process (take notes, photographs, etc.). The  data were elicited using the four-square methodology explained in the Protocol document.

"In each of the eight villages, one focus group discussion was held, but including both men and women participants. Each group will deal with the three aspects for discussion:
Useful biological diversity in the production system; Market diversity; and Dietary diversity.  There were between 10-16 participants in each group. Each group tried to include a cross-section of individuals involved in agricultural production or at least collecting useful plants from common lands and the wild, representing different levels of access to land (land owners, local land renters and migrant land renters), different ethnic groups present in the village and different age groups (special emphasis should be placed to include younger farmers). For each group there were two facilitators, one to guide the exercise and the other to document the process (take notes, photographs, etc.). The  data were elicited using the four-square methodology explained in the Protocol document."
Eight villages of three districts were surveyed:  (Balmer, Jaisalmer and Jodhpur) in the State of Rajasthan:  Damodara (26Â°54',70Â°43'); Deda (26Â°94',70Â°43'); Dedhu, (27Â°20', 71Â°45'); Dhirasar (25Â°27', 71Â°11'); Dhok (25Â°29', 71Â°01'); Govindupura (26Â°49', 73Â°05'); Mansagar (26Â°45', 73Â°08'); Meghwalo Ki Dhani (27.3711Â° N, 72.2334Â° E, this village was not part of the household survey).

Two FGDs per village in three villages. FGDs were held separately for men and women in order to collect gender disaggregated data.
In each of the three villages, two focus group discussions were held separately. One with men and the other with women. Each group will deal with the three aspects for discussion:
Useful biological diversity in the production system; Market diversity; and Dietary diversity.  There were between 10-16 participants in each group. Each group tried to include a cross-section of individuals involved in agricultural production or at least collecting useful plants from common lands and the wild, representing different levels of access to land (land owners, local land renters and migrant land renters), different ethnic groups present in the village and different age groups (special emphasis should be placed to include younger farmers). For each group there were two facilitators, one to guide the exercise and the other to document the process (take notes, photographs, etc.). The  data were elicited using the four-cell analysis methodology explained in the Protocol document.

Information was collected for  each species on its place of production or collection (farm, home garden, collected in the wild, etc.), the objective for its production or collection (Self-consumption, sale in the market, both), its different uses (food, medicine, animal feed, building material, processing, etc.), seasonality, the number of types, varieties and breeds recognized and used, key characteristics of its seed system (sources of seed, transactions and social relationships), and the water regime associated with its production (rainfed, irrigated, water harvest, etc.). Also data on assets and other socioeconomic indicators were collected.
A household survey was carried out with a representative random sample of 60 households per village in three villages in the district of Lawra, (part of the Wa, Bobo and Sikasso transect where the CRP Dryland System is working in West Africa). Three villages were selected. The total sample size is 180 households.

Two FGDs per village in three villages. FGDs were held separately for men and women in order to collect gender disaggregated data.
In each of the three villages, two focus group discussions were held separately. One with men and the other with women. Each group will deal with the three aspects for discussion:
Useful biological diversity in the production system; Market diversity; and Dietary diversity.  There were between 10-16 participants in each group. Each group tried to include a cross-section of individuals involved in agricultural production or at least collecting useful plants from common lands and the wild, representing different levels of access to land (land owners, local land renters and migrant land renters), different ethnic groups present in the village and different age groups (special emphasis should be placed to include younger farmers). For each group there were two facilitators, one to guide the exercise and the other to document the process (take notes, photographs, etc.). The  data were elicited using the four-square methodology explained in the Protocol document. Three villages in the Bijapur District: Mannur, Nandyal, Balaganur.
